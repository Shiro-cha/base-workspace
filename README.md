# Base Workspace üßë‚Äçüíª

This is my base workspace for all my projects. It contains a portable [docker](https://docker.com) environment with [vscode tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels) already configured, provisioned using [terraform](https://terraform.io).

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

A new Docker container will be created with the name `base-workspace` with [pkgx](https://pkgx.sh), [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/), [atuin](https://atuin.sh/) and vscode server installed.

To connect to the environment, run:

```bash
docker logs base-workspace
```

and follow the vscode tunnel instructions.

You can also enter to the environment using:

```bash
docker exec -it base-workspace bash
```

## ‚ú® Bonus

[oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) and [atuin](https://atuin.sh/) are already configured in the environment.
